PREFACE.

...m-..-

Tura volume contains the substance of the earliest coroners' rolls
g and of several lator coroners' rolls. A selection of cases only has
been made lrom most of the later rolls. The square brackets in tho
translation include brist abstracte of matter which it was decmed
expedient to omit in the Latin text. The aim ol the Editor has been
to'print cases that would best illustrate tho iunctione of the coroner
and the coroner’s jury. Incidentally this volume also throws much

light upon the activity of the neighbouring townships and upon the

work ottho county courts. Some ol tha rolls are worded as though
they were regular minutes of tho oriminal proceedings in those courts.

My best thanks are due to Miss Mass laroc Mssrrw for transcrib-
ing many ol tho rolls; to Mr. G. J. Tunnica for collating the text
' with the originale 3 to ΜΓ. Β. Fossnrr Locis, tho Honorary Secretary
ol the Society, for considerable assistance ol various kinds; to
Dr. Nonum Moosn for suggestions in medical matters ; and, notably,
to Professor F. W. Murciae, whose generous aid hasbeen ol

inestimable value. Ο G
