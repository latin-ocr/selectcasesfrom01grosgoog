justice. The police system ol medieval England was largely based 011
the principle of the responsibility 01 111011 01 the neighbourhood. The
hundred was responsible for ‘murder' and robbery,l the township
lor homicide committed during the daytime,² the frankpledge or
tithing for the crimes of its members. These communal liabilities
seem to postulate a fully developed system 01 seli-government; but,
since the Norman Conquest, the local communities were ireely ex·
ploited by the strong central government‚ and became an important
source ol royal revcnue; the townships were amerced for trivial as
well as serious offences.

111010110110.8 There are some indicatione that its germ existed in the
Anglo-Saxon period. ‘Il a person robs another, and he proolaims it
in three vills [“ tuns ”], he [the robber] is not to be worthy of pesce’
(AEthelrcd iii. l5; Schmid, Gesetze, 218). ‘Il a person finds stray
cattle or other property, let notice be given [to the neighbouring vills]
011 three sides that they may be witness ci the thing found’ (Wm. i.
6 ; Schmid, 829).⁴ ‘When anyone cleims cattle which is in the
hands 01 another, 11 the latter can prove ‘⁴ per tres portes visneti”
that it is 01 his breeding, then he has disproved the claim’ (Wm. i.
213 Schmid, 339). ‘Il a person finds cattle or other property, let
him go to the chureh, and, in the presence 01 the priest, reove, and
best men 011110 vill, display what he has found3 and let the reeve
send to three or four neighbouring vills lor the priests and reeves,
who ars to bring with them four 01 the best men 01 each vill ; and let
the property be displayed to them assembled together’ (Edw. Oonf.

usages or whether most 01 1110111 were established alter the Norman
Conquest; the law 01 AEthelred shows, however, that the neighbouring
vills acted ae legal witnesses among the Aegle-Saxone. In the tenth,

bouring hundreds combined for j udiciel purposes.⁶
