an ardent supportet 01 John's conspiracy against the erowu. Hugh
de Severbi must, therefore, have made his accusation in the oounty
court before the end of March 1194, and hence before September

1194, in which latter month the articles 01 the eyre were issucd.¹ It
is very probable that the knights or coronare reported at Westminster
what had taken place in their presence in the oounty court, for we
know that throughout the thirteenth century it was the function 01
the coroner 10 receive appeals 01 accusations in that court.² We may,
then, infer that these ‘milites custodientes’ existed before the end 01
March 1194. Both Geolfrcy Fila-Peter and William de Stuttville
acted as itinerant justices in the great cyre which began 111 work in
September 1194,1 and the case 01 Hugh v. Alured and Jordan probably
came before them in that syre, before it was reported 11 Westminster.

7. Professor Maitland admits 11111 the ‘milites custodientes ’ were

ew· coronera; 11111 Geolfrey Fitz-Peter andWilliam de Stuttville probably

found coronare in Lincolnshire during the eyre from which they had
recently returned; and that 1111 10101111 bore witness 10 something
11111 happened before the issue of the articles 01 tha cyre. But 111
maintains that they did not hold an official position when that 10111·
thing happened. ‘That something,’ ha adds, ‘was a proceeding in
the oounty court; the coroners were knights 01 the shire, and, after
all, they only said what the whole oounty said! ⁴ 'l'his may be true,
but the ‘milites’ say in this record just what knights who were
coroners often say in recorda 01 the time 01 John and Henry IIL:
at the eyre they 111 asked to report concerning appeals 01 felony 11111
have been made 11 their presence.⁶ Il, then, we may judge from later
analogy, the ‘milites' in 1194 report as coronare and not as knights
of the abire. Moreover, it seems somewhat improbable that the two
justices could have found coronare in Lincolnshire, if we accept the
orthodox view that their office was created by tha articles 01 that eyre;

some weeks would elapsa between 1111 establishment 01 tho office and
the election of coroners in the county court.
