four ville that made the preliminary inquiry before the coroner would
oft ten participate in the final trial before the justiccs.¹ The jury of
twelve men of the hundred also had its counterpart m many coroners’
inquests. In these inquests‚ as iu the eyre, the twelve Jurors brought

mtheir verdict either byt themselves or in conjunct ion w1t ‘th the four
vills.² Moreover, ths coroner himself was sometimes reques ted by
the justices to give evidence,³ which must often have modified the
verdict.

8. There is another way in which the coroner’s inquest may have

seimsss influenced the growth of trial by jury. At some of the inquests

evidence of persons not on the jury was taken.⁴ The facts so ascer-
tained were entered in the ‘rotuli coronatoris‘ for use before the
itinerant justices. The evidence produced at the inquest would also
generally bs known to the representatives of the townships, and, when
they noted in conjunction with the trial jury, would have weight in
the final proceedings at the eyre. Thus iu the coroner's jury there
seems to have been, at least in some cases, a nearer approach to the
determination of truth from the evidence of witnesses thau in the
early petty jury, whose verdict was based on previous knowledge of
facts. The coroner’s jury may, indeed, be regarded as one of the
links uniting the old system of procedure to the modern practice of
deciding matters upon the evidence of witnesses openly examined in
court. ι

v1. The Principio or representation.

οἳξ, ιΙΙ 1. One more phase of our subject deserves attention: namely, the
⁰ influence of this office upon the principle of representation. The

coroner’s jury, like all other kinds of jurias, was itself a representative
body, and its frequent use makes it a conspicuous example of early
representation for local purposes. rue growth of this principle and
its extension to Parliament thave been fully considered by such writers
