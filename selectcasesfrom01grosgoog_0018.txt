fflgffi 2. These recorde are not the original ‘rotuli coronatorum,’ but
merely transcripte and in some cases abstracte 01 1110 originale. The

following reasons may be advanced in support 01 thie view. (1) In
many years no inquests or only one or two inquests are recorded,
whereas itis quite certain that many cases usually came before the
coroner in the course 01 each year. For some years the transcripte
seem to be very full, for others very meagre or entirely wanting.l
(2) On some membranas the entriee are arranged in a haphazard
way without regcrd to chronological sequence. (3) Each coroner had
his' own record,² but in this series 01 10110 the cases coming belors
different coronare are olten intermingled. (4) There are mistalres in
dates and in the names of places which indicate hasty or careless
transcription. (5) Certain statements in some 01 the rolla regarding
deficientias of the coroner³ and certain allusione to the king’s juetices
in some 01 the headinge⁴ afford more positive evidence 01 transcription.

doubtless contemporary or almost contemporary with the originale.
They contain little or no direct testimony regarding their origin and
object. We know that the coroners’ rolls were laid before the royal
justices at the eyre,5 and our rolls seem to be abstracte made by order

the property 01 telone in the body 01 1110 cases and in the marginal ,
notes indicates that the rolle were made especially for the use 01 1110
royal treasury. Britton (i. 133) says that at the cyre entreats 01
amercements and 01 1110 fines and chattels 01 salone were made and
