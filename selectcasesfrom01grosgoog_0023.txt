to the office. Even after 1194 such recorda as the Roruli Curiae
Regis rarely mention coroners during the reign of Richard Ι. ,
raone 9. Some writers have ascribed their origin to the Anglo-Saxon

uua dell-

ncayaa. period.¹ This view is improbable, because the power of the royel
{iiiiiiH judicature and the idea oi crown pleae were not yet lully developed
“ ⁹⁰¹¹ ' under the Angla-Saron kings. As the jurisdiction of the Curia Regis
gradually increased and that of the local public courts diminished in
the century following the Norman Conquest, the king’s peace was ex·
tended, the category ol crown pleae was enlargcd,² and new agents
were therefore needed to see that criminals were brought to trial
before the itinerant justices. The coroner was, in lact, an important
concomitant of the eyrc system3 the latter needed the active co·
operation of the former. Both existed primarily ior the lring'e profit ;3
both were uecful adjuncts of a highly-centralised government. The
development ol coroners may thus have beon contemporary with that ι
of the itinerant justices3 both offices, perhaps, were tentatively em·
ployed under Henry I., fell in abeyanoe under Stephen, and were
firmly established under Henry II. Morcover, Henry Il. strove to
curtail the authority of the sheriffsr‘e Some ol their iunctione ulti·
mately passed to the coroners, and the latter acted as a checlr on the
former.⁵ The rise of the coroner seems to imply a corresponding
depression of ‘the sheriff; the establishment of the new office may
have been the result of Henry IL’s policy of reduoing the power ol
the sherilis, consolidating the lring’s peace, and centring the adminis-
tration oi justice in the itinerant justices and the Curia Re's.
Whether this hypothesis is tenable or not, it is probable that chapter
20 of the articles of 1194 is merely a declaratory aot, referring to an

institution which was already in existence.
