It happened at Barnaak on Friday¹ next before the feast of St.
Matthew the Apostle in the eighth year of King Edward that John
Baker of Pilegate died in his house at Pilsgate, having confessed and
partaken of the communion ; and he was buried without view of the
coroner. And on the same day R. de Vere, the king'a coroner in
Northamptonshire,came there and caused John’s body to be disinterred,
and he found a wound on J ohn’s head, which seemingly had been made
withan are. Inquest was made before the said R. de Vere by four
neighbouring townships, to wit, Barnack, Pilsgate‚ Walton, and
Bainton. [They say that John was beating his wife Emma, and she
raised the hue. Her brother came, and, with her assent, mortally
wounded John with an axe, which was worth a penny. Emma and
her brother were arrested and placed in charge of the bailiffs of the
abbot of Peterborough.]
